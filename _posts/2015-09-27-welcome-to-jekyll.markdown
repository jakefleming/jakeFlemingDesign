During “Dance At Judson And On And On And On”, Rosemary will be part of the symposium “Judson and Beyond” alongside Ramsay Burt, Bojana Cveijc, Kirsten Maar and Martina Ruhsam.
 
The symposium takes place in the context of a special cooperation with the Städtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus. The point of departure is the phase of art history in which both visual artists and choreographers founded a groundbreaking laboratory that tested the art forms’ limits between 1962 and 1964: the Judson Dance Theater.
